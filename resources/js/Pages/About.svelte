        <p>
            Whenever Will has a live event, stream, or socials post, should it
            contain relevant information about his works, it is recorded here
            within the Archive. Many of these blurbs are canon or give some
            additional insight to Will's worlds, writing process, and humor.
            After being transcribed by community members the so-called <a
                use:inertia
                href={route('search')}>Reports</a> are fully text searchable for
            people to browse and link to for discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
            This site is maintained and built by the Will Wight fanbase and
            community.
